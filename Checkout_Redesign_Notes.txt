Redesigned Checkout Flow â€“ E-Commerce Website (Desktop)

Original Pain Points:
---------------------
1. Multi-page checkout process leads to user frustration and increased dropout.
2. Users are forced to repeatedly enter the same details (e.g., shipping and billing).
3. Lack of real-time order summary; total cost often shown at the end.
4. Unnecessary steps like account creation or captcha interrupt flow.
5. Forms were cluttered and lacked guidance (e.g., field labels, validation hints).

Redesign Improvements:
----------------------
1. All-in-one single-page checkout with clean visual hierarchy.
2. Clearly separated sections: Shipping Info, Payment Method, and Order Summary.
3. Real-time order cost shown in a summary box to build user trust.
4. Intuitive inputs and simplified options (dropdowns, placeholders).
5. Reduced friction with a single 'Place Order' CTA.
6. Minimalist design to improve focus and reduce cognitive load.
7. Responsive layout ready for desktop with accessibility in mind.

Impact:
-------
Streamlined checkout reduces user fatigue.
Higher completion rates.
Lower cart abandonment.
Improved accessibility and user satisfaction.
